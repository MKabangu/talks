<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: C. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension**

**Explanation:** Sarah's symptoms of severe headaches, visual disturbances, and pulsatile tinnitus are characteristic of IIH, especially when accompanied by papilledema, which should be confirmed on further examination.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visit to the Primary Care Physician {transition="slide"}

Sarah's primary care physician performs a comprehensive history and physical examination. Given her symptoms, Sarah is referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation of her visual complaints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
During the ophthalmology appointment, the ophthalmologist performs a fundoscopy and discovers papilledema. What does the presence of papilledema suggest in the context of Sarah's symptoms?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
It is a benign finding with no significance
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
It suggests increased intracranial pressure
:::

::: choice
It indicates a possible retinal detachment
:::

::: choice
It confirms a diagnosis of glaucoma
:::

::: choice
It is indicative of optic neuritis
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: B. It suggests increased intracranial pressure**

**Explanation:** Papilledema is swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure, which aligns with Sarah's symptoms of headaches and vision changes. It requires prompt further investigation.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Seeking Further Medical Attention

Following the discovery of papilledema, Sarah's ophthalmologist refers her back to the primary care physician with a recommendation for neuroimaging and further evaluation by a neurologist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
What is the next best step in the evaluation of Sarah's condition, considering her symptoms and the finding of papilledema?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Prescribe migraine medication
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
Order a brain MRI and MRV
:::

::: choice
Start corticosteroids
:::

::: choice
Refer to a neurologist
:::

::: choice
Schedule a follow-up in three months
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: B. Order a brain MRI and MRV**

**Explanation:** The next step is to confirm the diagnosis of IIH and rule out other causes of increased intracranial pressure. An MRI can help exclude mass lesions, while an MRV can identify venous sinus stenosis.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Diagnostic Imaging

Sarah undergoes a brain MRI, which comes back normal, ruling out any masses or structural abnormalities. However, the MRV reveals stenosis of the transverse sinuses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
What is the most appropriate initial step in management?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Observe and re-evaluate in six months
:::

::: choice
Start migraine prophylaxis
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
Perform a lumbar puncture to assess opening pressure
:::

::: choice
Immediate venous sinus stenting
:::

::: choice
Initiate anti-inflammatory treatment
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: C. Perform a lumbar puncture to assess opening pressure**

**Explanation:** Given the MRI findings and symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, a lumbar puncture is crucial to measure the opening pressure and confirm the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Management Plan

Sarah's lumbar puncture reveals an elevated opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, confirming the diagnosis of IIH. Initial management with acetazolamide 500 mg twice daily and lifestyle modifications is started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
What is the primary mechanism of action of acetazolamide in the management of IIH?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Increases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
Decreases CSF production
:::

::: choice
Reduces cerebral blood flow
:::

::: choice
Acts as a diuretic to reduce intracranial pressure
:::

::: choice
Enhances cerebral oxygen delivery
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: B. Decreases CSF production**

**Explanation:** Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, thereby lowering intracranial pressure. This is supported by clinical guidelines for IIH management.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Persistent Symptoms

Despite initial treatment with acetazolamide and lifestyle modifications, Sarah's symptoms persist, and her vision continues to deteriorate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
According to the latest guidelines, what is the recommended next step in Sarah's management, considering her refractory symptoms and worsening vision?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Add topiramate to her treatment
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
Increase the dose of acetazolamide to 1000 mg twice daily
:::

::: choice
Refer to interventional radiology for dural sinus stenting
:::

::: choice
Start corticosteroids
:::

::: choice
Observe and re-evaluate in six months
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: B. Increase the dose of acetazolamide to 1000 mg twice daily**

**Explanation:** Before proceeding to more invasive options, increasing the dose of acetazolamide is a reasonable next step to attempt to better manage intracranial pressure as per guidelines.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Counseling on Treatment Options

Sarah's symptoms remain refractory to maximum medical therapy. She is counseled on further treatment options, including ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and dural sinus stenting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
What are key factors to consider when counseling a patient on choosing between a VP shunt and dural sinus stenting for IIH?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Invasiveness of the procedure
:::

::: choice
Risk of complications and need for revisions
:::

::: choice
Patient preference and lifestyle
:::

::: {.choice .correct-choice}
All of the above
:::

::: choice
Cost and accessibility of treatment
:::
:::
:::

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: D. All of the above**

**Explanation:** Key factors include the invasiveness of the procedure, the risk of complications and need for revisions, and the patient's preference and lifestyle. Dural sinus stenting is less invasive and typically has fewer complications compared to VP shunting.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision and Procedure

Sarah opts for dural sinus stenting after discussing her options with her healthcare team. She is referred to an interventional radiologist and undergoes venous angiogram to evaluate for stenosis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: D. 8 mmHg**

**Explanation:** According to guidelines, a minimum pressure gradient of 4 mmHg is recommended on venography to justify st

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Follow-Up and Outcome

After the stenting procedure, Sarah's symptoms significantly improve. Her headaches diminish, her vision is restored, and the pulsatile tinnitus resolves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: question
What follow-up care is recommended for Sarah post-stenting to ensure continued improvement and monitor for potential complications?

<br>

<br>

::: choices
::: choice
Regular neurological assessments

<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer: D. All of the above**

**Explanation:** Post-stenting care includes regular neurological assessments, periodic imaging to ensure the stent remains patent, and continued acetazolamide therapy to manage intracranial pressure. These recommendations align with follow-up guidelines for IIH.
